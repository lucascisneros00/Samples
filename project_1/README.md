# Predicting credit card fraud with Machine Learning

I employ Machine Learning clasification methods for determining whether a credit card transaction
is fradulent or not. I train the models and tweak hyperparameters to improve performance.

# Data
The data set contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders, in a diluted version
which contains 80,000 observations. The label (dependent variable) indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent,
and all other variables are confidential (V1-V28).
