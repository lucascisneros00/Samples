# Project for predicting credit card fraud with Machine Learning

It is very important for banks to ensure their clients have the best possible service.
Thus, it is crucial for them to be able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions,
so that customers are not charged for items they did not purchase. The main objective of the analysis
is to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not, given a set of features the banks have access to.

# Data
The data set contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders, in a diluted version
which contains 80,000 observations. The label (dependent variable) indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent,
and all other variables are confidential (V1-V28).
