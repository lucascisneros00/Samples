# Predicting the S&P500
Deep Neural Networks have seen a great surge in popularity among Financial Analysts,
because of their ability to discern very complex patterns in data. Coupled with increasing computing power,
these models have become very useful for computing financial estimates with large data sets.
The main objective of this analysis is, precisely, to take advantage of Deep Learning models to predict
the SPY ETF (which tracks the S&P 500 Index) and to compare these with traditional time series models 
(ARIMA, GARCH).

# Data
The data consists of daily prices of the SPY Index for the year 2021 (247 obs.), retrieved from Yahoo! Finance.
